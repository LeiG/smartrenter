# Smart Renter

Smart Renter is a map-based application that shows best real estate
investment opportunities.

A user can enter a property address (disclaimer: the default property
`632 Matsonia Dr, Foster City, CA 94404` is a random house near by my
apartment) as an anchor to get a list of similar properties in the
neighborhood and then specify criterion to narrow down the ones to
further investigate.

The map application is built using Google Map API and the property
data is pulled from Zillow API.

To run the application locally, one just needs to open up the
`index.html` file and make sure proper internet connection.
